# Setup
- Manual setup

```
 
 
# How to use
I developed this tool to be easily managed and upgraded so i created it as small plugin systems connected together

## Plugins and usage
```
lib\plugins\experimental\cache_poisoning.py : [--cache-poisoning] Check if the host is vulnerable to cache poisoning
lib\plugins\crlf.py   : [--crlf] Check if Host is Vulnerable To CRLF

 $ domainker -d mydomains_list.txt [.. Plugins]

 ```
You could also use multiple plugins at the same time

```

http://sub.domain.com  
sub.domain.com  
.sub.domain.com
```
Which generated by:
- amass  
- aquatone (hosts.txt)  
- subfinder  
- sublist3r  
... and many other subdomain finders
